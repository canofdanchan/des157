      <p>This activity will prompt you with questions revolving around the word “build”. Consider <span>conceptual</span>, rather than literal meanings</p>
      <p><span>examples can include:</span> connections, relationships, communities, home, belonging, safety, dreams, goals, future, fulfillment </p>
      <p id=note>*Note: your answers do not have to revolve around any of these, they are simply here to guide you into thinking deeper about what “build” can mean to you.</p>

      <h5>Creator's Interpretation</h5>
      <p> To build something is to bring something into existence, with mind, soul, and body. Building requires carefully navigating the world so that what is built doesn’t bring harm to anyone else but allows the person to create whatever they need to.</p>
