      <h1> Audience Test Results </h1>
      <article>
      <img src=images/testers.jpg alt="glenda and sophie sitting at a laptop looking at my project">
      <p> Three people tested my project: Sophie, Glenda, and Emily. They all came from different backgrounds, and it was interesting to see how they all interpreted my ideas. Some of my audience testers gave me the same feedback, so I will definitely be keeping those feedback in mind. I was nervous to show poeple my project and see what they thought of it, but I enjoyed the experience!</p>

      <h2> Things to Change </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> more description on what "build", "hold", and "ground" means to me, so the user knows how I'm thinking about it (put this at the start of each module)</li>
        <li> adding more action items at the end of each module: more resources (specific to each module) and also what the purpose of the answers are (what I want the user to do with all their answers)</li>
        <li> changing buttons so that the buttons for each module are different than the buttons for the nav / contact (keep visual strategies for similar things the same)</li>
      </ul>
