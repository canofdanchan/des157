        <h1> Project Brief </h1>

        <h2> Topic Summary </h2>
        <p>“How do you want to heal?” (tentative title) is an introspective tool for community organizers and activists to self care. I attempt to create a more collective and holistic approach to self care, instead of mainstream materialistic movements that focus on bath bombs, face masks, and the like. My hope is that through this introspection, my users will be able to look at themselves and their connections critically, and learn how to form healthier connections (with themselves and others). Inthis way, my goal is to connect self care with community care, and to show that self and community care go hand in hand: that to nurture yourself is to also nurture your community.
        </p>

        <p> “How do you want to heal?” uses simple words (that have specific connotations in community spaces) as tools to guide the user through a reflection process. For this project, I have chosen the words “build”, “hold”, and “ground”.
        </p>

        <p> <span> The Significance of These Words in Community Organizing </span> <br> These specific words (build, hold, ground) can have very literal meanings and physical connotations. For example, to “build” is a physical action that can be applied to furniture, houses, etc. However, in community spaces, these physical words are taken out of their literal context and used in intangible and theoretical ways. Here, the term “build” is used to refer to community, connections, and a sense of home rather than a literal house. It’s crucial to recognize that the physical and literal element of these words are an important part of the reason they’re such useful tools for community organizers. I’ve noticed metaphors are common in community spaces  because they can help visualize and conceptualize the grassroots work that we do. When it’s too hard to explain the fulfillment associated with pouring your soul into your community, we say that we’ve “built a home” with the people around us. This way, we can convey our feelings in a way that other people can understand in a profound, yet simple, way.
        </p>

        <h2> Target Audience Description </h2>
        <p> My target audience are people who have a <span>multiplicity of marginalized identities</span> and who are familiar with community organizing but may not necessarily have one solid community they lean on for support. They might feel <span>isolated</span>, especially having to exist in a hegemonic society that alienates them for their marginalized identities. Therefore, the <span>concept of community is important</span> to them: both staying connected to a community and doing work for their community through advocacy work, mentorship programs, etc. They might <span>not have access to professional counseling or healing services</span> (due to time or financial limitations) but are still <span>interested in exploring ways to take care of themselves,</span> whether that be by themselves (self care),or through people in their community (community care).
        </p>

        <h2> The Goals of the Project </h2>
        <p>The goal of my project is to examine the idea of self care on a deeper level and connect the idea of community care to self care. By encouraging introspection through interactive prompts, my users will be able to look at themselves and their connections critically, and learn how to form healthier connections (with themselves and others). In this way, I hope to show that self care and community care go hand in hand: that to nurture yourself is to also nurture your community.
        </p>

        <p>My project currently has 3 parts (that correspond to the 3 words that I have chosen): “build”, “hold”, and “ground”. Each of these words encompass an interactive introspective journey, facilitated by various questions that will be posed to the user. For example, in “hold” I ask questions like “what do you hold close to you?”, “how does it feel when you forget to hold your values close?”, “who do you enact these values for?”.
        </p>

        <h2> Goals for the Overall Look and Feel </h2>
        <p>I will correspond an illustration with each of my 3 words. The illustrations are separated into sections. For example, for “build”, the illustration is of the different pieces of a birdhouse<span>*</span> (ex roof, front, side, back, etc). With each question that is answered, the illustration comes together. For “build”, I have 5 questions and 5 pieces. When all 5 questions are answered, all 5 pieces finally appear.
        </p>

        <p>At the end of each set of prompts / the “end” of the word, all of the user’s answers will appear next to a finished illustration, that they can email to themselves (I cannot store any information because I don’t know how databases or back-end coding works).
        </p>

        <p>I want the visual feel to be simple, yet calming. I don’t want my design to be overly cold or minimal, because I want to stray away from corporate aesthetics. I may want to incorporate some digitally hand drawn elements, to give it a more human feel. I do want to use soft (somewhat pastel) colors, and perhaps associate each word with a specific color palette?
