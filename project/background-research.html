    For this project, I want to focus on stories of hope, transformative love, and radical healing, rather than stories of trauma and the tokenization and trauma porn that can come out of focusing on the negative experiences of “diverse” people. Additionally, I want my project to have underlying themes of community and self care. My research focuses on community care for marginalized people as well as self care that strays away from mainstream interpretations that commodify the idea of self care and usually require you to buy yourself something to “feel better” (i.e. a scented candle, chocolate, face masks, bubble baths, etc) because we all know that in a capitalist society, the solution is to spend money. Speaking of which, capitalism in today’s society is inherently tied with neoliberalism: the idea that individuals need to be self sufficient without outside help. These ideals isolate marginalized people from each other, while denying them of resources and then blaming them for problems that would’ve been solved with community, and with the needed resources. Thus, my project also serves as a critique of these notions (i.e. our neoliberalist capitalist society).
  </p>

  <p>
    To be able to achieve a form of self / community care that goes beyond the mainstream, we have to deconstruct the systems that allow this mainstream form of self care to be. As mentioned already, we live in a neoliberalist capitalist society, but hidden in that is also the perpetuation of productivity culture and ableism. Mainstream self care movements perpetuate productivity culture by suggesting that the goal of self care, of rest, is that, ultimately, you can be a functioning, productive human being again, and return to the work that you need to do, rejuvenated and refreshed. I challenge this purpose of self care. I challenge self care to be used for healing, and to grow one’s capacity for love (for yourself and others).
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to productivity culture, we must also deconstruct the ableism that is perpetuated by mainstream self care movements. These movements focus on the actions of the individual, and put the burden of taking care of oneself on each individual. However, as people, we are not meant to solve all of our problems by ourselves. And especially as a disabled person, it’s incredibly difficult to “self care” when I don’t even have the energy (or am in too much pain) to do something as simple as washing my hair. Furthermore, in a society that demonizes those with disabilities and portrays them as “lazy” or “useless” it’s even harder to reach out for help when I need it.
  </p>

  <p>
    This brings me to my last point, the importance of community care as related to self care (i.e. that community care and self care can and should be intertwined processes). As a closing statement to “Independence is an Ableist Myth: Unlocking the Power of Community in Healing,” Dom Chatterjee says, “There are many false beliefs in society that drive us to work harder and harder, while asking for less and less help. And we can’t change the structure of our capitalist societies without challenging the myth of self-sufficiency in the small moments of our lives, shifting behavior over time to be less independent and more interconnected.” For me, self care should be possible because I have a community to back me up and take care of me when I need them to. Additionally, loving myself and taking care of my own emotional needs should come hand in hand with demanding and expecting less of other people, and accepting other people and their flaws. In this way, self care is also more than material needs that can be bought; it becomes a process of self growth, of finding ways to satisfy your own emotional needs and allowing yourself to heal, from the inside out.
  </p>

  <p>
    I want to imagine a kind of self care that takes into consideration the connections we have around us. I want to imagine a self care that is intrinsically intertwined with our communities, but without depending or relying on them in unhealthy ways. I want to explore what self care looks like in this setting, and how it can be applied on micro (individual), meso (community), and macro (global) scales. I also want to explore self care in one’s relationship with themselves; i.e. the internal caring and healing that’s harder to reach and harder to solve.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lastly, I want to bring up a resource I found called “Sacred Practices of Resilience and Resistance” that describes some nonconformative / nontraditional methods of self / community care. This connects with my original idea, of putting visual metaphors to words commonly used in community organizing spaces (ex building, kindling, growing, etc). This resource lists different simple verbs (ex see, make, breathe) and lists forms of self / community care that can be categorized under these words. I love this resource because it goes beyond literal meanings of these words. For example, under “see,” the contributor urges you to “Look at your relationships” because how you “see” people can give insights to how unhealthy / healthy your relationship with yourself is. I’m hoping I can have this sort of approach to my project, to use everyday words in creative contexts that allow people to heal through self and community care.
