        <p> I drew my home page, that would direct to each of my three words. The people I spoke to gave me feedback on including more information on what my project is about and how to use it (for people not familiar with community organizing / healing justice). After a couple iterations (as seen on the bottom of the page), I decided the best idea would be to add a blurb on my landing page, that people could click, directing them to the about page to learn more. </p>
