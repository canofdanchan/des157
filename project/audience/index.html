            <h1> Audience Research </h1>
        </header>

        <p>
            My target audience are people who have a multiplicity of marginalized identities and who are familiar with community organizing but may not necessarily have one solid community they lean on for support. They might feel isolated, especially having to exist
            in a hegemonic society that alienates them for their marginalized identities. Therefore, the concept of community is important to them: both staying connected to a community and doing work for their community through advocacy work, mentorship
            programs, etc. They might not have access to professional counseling or healing services (due to time or financial limitations) but are still interested in exploring ways to take care of themselves, whether that be by themselves (self care),
            or through people in their community (community care).
