  <p> The storyboard on the left represents the setting (both physical and emotional) as well as the user experience of my project. The storyboard on the right represents the technical interface of my project.</p>

  <p> On the left, the user can be anywhere, but usually alone (and/or feeling alone, as shown by the bottom left panel). My user feels a sense of isolation or detachment and is looking to connect with themselves to untangle their negative feelings or thoughts. This untangling is shwon in the bottom right panel, where the user gets a stronger idea of where they are personally and finds a sense of guidance. My project is meant to be returned to, as shown by the very bottom panel. When my user feels tangled again, they can return to my project and find more ways to untangle themselves.</p>

  <p> On the right, I show the three words that I am using as prompts: build, hold, and ground. Each of these words have prompts that the user answers. This is based off of a more tangible version of Audre Lorde's Questionnaire for Everyday. The home page will feature links with all three words/prompts. There will also be an about page for people who are not familiar with the context of these words in community organizing (although people familiar with community organizing is my target audience). The visual imagery associated with each word will change as the user answers more questions per each prompt. At the end, their questions will have created the final product, along with a page showing all of their answers.</p>
