            <h2>Digital Approach</h2>
            <p> This would be the direction I would go if I didn't include any analog elements (i.e. drawings or photographs). I would like solid pastel colors, with white accents. OR lots of white space and pastel accents / illustrations. </p>

            <h2>Analog Approach</h2>
            <p> This would be the direction I would go if I didn't use vector illustrations. I would combine photographs with hand drawn elements, maybe using colored filters (so that each word would have a distinct palette).</p>
            <img src="images/moodboard2.jpg" alt="also a moodboard with a lot of pink and notes written on it">

            <p> For both directions, I might want to play more with typography, especially in the illustrations, if time allows and if it doesn't require extra coding. I also want to be more creative in my color palettes, but keep to my own style while not using too harsh of colors.</p>
