            <p> I carry 70% of my life in my laptop (the other 30% is my phone). As a designer, I need a machine that'll be able to run 20 billion browser tabs and hella design programs at the same time. It also holds all my class files, notes, etc, etc (I
                have chronic pain so I can't carry very many physical things). </p>

            <p> I carry 30% of my life in my phone (the other 70% is my laptop). Here I have notes & reminders (bc I forget everything) and tons of social media apps. Most of my close friends are really busy or live really far from me, so it's a great way
                to stay connected. It's also a good way to communicate quickly and efficiently with coworkers (although I should try to actually relax more often instead of working).</p>

            <p> There's always a million thoughts in my head that I have to document. Either with a pen, or a note app, I write down all my thoughts so they can (hopefully) be less cluttered.</p>
